WinGet packaging (Windows Package Manager)

Overview
- Goal: publish the portable ZIP of WSL Profile Switcher to WinGet so users can install via `winget install yweis.WSLProfileSwitcher`.
- Recommended installer type: Portable ZIP that contains `WSLProfileTray.exe` plus `icons/`.

Manual submission (quickest)
1) Create a tagged release on GitHub that includes the ZIP produced by `scripts/package.ps1` (e.g., `WSLProfileTray-1.0.0-portable.zip`).
2) Install the wingetcreate CLI:
   - `winget install Microsoft.WingetCreate`
3) Run:
   - `wingetcreate new <ZIP_URL>`
   - Follow prompts (Publisher: `yweis`, Package: `WSLProfileSwitcher`, Identifier: `yweis.WSLProfileSwitcher`)
   - Choose installer type: `portable`
   - For `ProductCode`, leave empty. For `PortableCommandAlias`, leave empty (GUI app).
4) Submit the PR generated by wingetcreate to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.

Optional: automate PRs on release
- Add a repository secret `WINGET_TOKEN` (a classic PAT with `repo` scope for PRs to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`).
- Add a workflow that calls `vedantmgoyal2009/winget-releaser` on `release` events and points to the ZIP asset.
- We can wire this up once your repo is public and the first release is created.

Notes
- WinGet expects stable, immutable release asset URLs. Avoid replacing an asset without bumping version.
- If you later move to an MSI, you can update the manifest to `installerType: msi` and include silent args.
